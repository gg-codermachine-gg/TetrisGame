# TetrisGame
game made in javascript using canvas 
Overview:
This project is a Tetris game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game has a simple user interface, where users can control the movement of falling blocks to fill the horizontal lines without any gaps. If the line is completely filled with blocks, it disappears, and the user gets points. The game gets faster and more challenging as the user scores more points.

How to Play:
To start the game, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The game will begin automatically. The user can control the movement of the falling blocks using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The up arrow key rotates the block, the left arrow key moves the block to the left, the right arrow key moves the block to the right, and the down arrow key speeds up the block's falling speed.

Game Structure:
The game consists of a playing field, which is a grid of cells, and a block, which is the shape that the user must place on the grid. The block is made up of smaller cells, and the user can control the movement of these cells using the arrow keys. Once the block is placed on the grid, it becomes a part of the grid, and the user must continue to fill horizontal lines without gaps using new blocks.

Scoring System:
The user earns points by filling horizontal lines completely without any gaps. The score increases with each completed line. The game gets faster and more challenging as the user scores more points.

Technical Details:
The game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game's playing field is created using HTML elements, and the block's movement is controlled using JavaScript functions. The game uses CSS animations to create the block's falling effect. The score and level are displayed on the screen using HTML and JavaScript.

Conclusion:
This Tetris game is a fun and challenging project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet engaging user interface. The game's mechanics are easy to understand, and the difficulty level increases as the user scores more points. The game can be improved by adding more levels, music, and sound effects.
